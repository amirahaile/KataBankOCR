# Kata Bank OCR
Code challenge for Test Double.

Incomplete solution for [Kata Bank OCR](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR) done within 2 hour timeframe.

Program input is a file upload done via the browser. The expected input is the file output of the "ingenious machine" described in the kata. A test file is included in the test directory.
